    <!--You use this configuration file to hold your API key. The template generates two google_maps_api.xml files:
    one for debug and one for release. The file for the API key for the debug certificate is located in
    src/debug/res/values. The file for the API key for the release certificate is located in
     src/release/res/values. In this practical you only use the debug certificate.-->

    <!--
    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=6E:B0:0A:E4:CC:53:28:93:04:B8:87:ED:43:26:8A:61:A7:A8:CC:CD%3Bcom.example.wander

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    com.example.wander

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    6E:B0:0A:E4:CC:53:28:93:04:B8:87:ED:43:26:8A:61:A7:A8:CC:CD

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
